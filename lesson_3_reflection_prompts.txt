When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you have multiple machines or you want to share your code. Also as a security backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I might be working on something locally and the remote can be shared
