When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you have multiple machines or you want to share your code. Also as a security backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I might be working on something locally and the remote can be shared

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork creates a copy of the directory from remote to remote.
Clone creates a copy of the directory from remote to local or from local to local.
Branches create a copy of the code of the branch you are working on.
If we want to copy someone else's directory to continue the work but we do not intend to apply changes on the first one we will use fork.
To create a new repository we will use clone.
To create a parallel copy of the code that we can then merge in the future to another branch, or for prototypes we will use branches

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
In case we need to work offline, is goot to have the last state of the remote updated so we can do merges and prepare everything for pushing when we are back online.
