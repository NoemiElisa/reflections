What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Some elements are created to track the commits. So we can initialize an empty git repository and commit files and keep track of them.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the part that will be commited and 'saved'.
Working directory is where you can modify files locally.
Repository is the whole group of files associated with the project you are working on
