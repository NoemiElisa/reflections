How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is easier to spot as I could only see the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would be easier to rollback to previous versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can forget to commit and end up with a version too difficult to understand, however you can have automatically saved versions that are unstable.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They are thought for different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to find the commit ids and git diff to check the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is easier to revert

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Personal projects and continue udacity courses
